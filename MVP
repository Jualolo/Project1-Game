Whack a mole! (based) Game:

✅Milestone 1: Set up workspace
    - Initial html and css✅

✅Milestone 2: Create object class, change color onclick

    -Object class ✅
    -Change color onclick (blue to red and back)✅
    -Change color inside with methods inside the classes ✅

    -Set object always same size ✅

✅Milestone 3: Set timer(1min), + Game over page

✅Milestone 4: Object disappears (no-click=2s)(on-click=2s+1s)

    -Remove child function✅
    -Set timesOut for the child removal✅
        -object disappears after being clicked (changeColor + 1s)✅
        -object disappears after 2 seconds of existing✅

Milestone 5: Set interval, object creation every 2-3 seconds

✅Milestone 6: Random positions objects 
--------------------
Milestone 7: CSS decoration


Problems to solve:
    -button must work on every object (check in M5)
    calling buttonClicked() on both objects returns twice the consl.log but after clicking the correct one once

    -Cannot set the timer to +1s for the onclick removal of the object✅

Notes:
    -querySelector selects the whole class but will only act in the clicked object
